# Getting Started

1. Thread is a sub process. A process can have multiple threads.
2. Threads share same address space (same memory).
3. Context switching between thread is easy compared to process since process requires updating the registers,memory mapping.
4. Each process have its own memory/address space.
5.Threads are independent and an exception in one thread doesn't have any impact on another thread.

6.In multitasking using threads though threads executes parallel , at a time only one thread is executed.
